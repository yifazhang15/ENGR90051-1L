                            We use data erasure methods compliant with US Department of Defense DoD 5220.22-M and NIST 800-88 standards, ensuring data is thoroughly overwritten multiple times and cannot be recovered using any existing technology. Each device undergoes at least three passes of data overwriting followed by verification.

                            All drop-off points are equipped with surveillance systems and access control, allowing only authorized personnel to handle devices. The entire process from drop-off to processing follows a strict chain of custody, ensuring devices are not accessed by unauthorized individuals. You can also choose to use anonymous drop-off via secure lockers without providing personal identification information.

                            After each device is processed, we provide a data erasure certificate detailing the time of erasure, methods used, and verification results. You can track your device processing status in real-time through our online platform, including data erasure confirmation. We also provide data erasure verification reports showing all sectors have been successfully overwritten.

We provide user-friendly data erasure tools and detailed guides supporting various common devices, including laptops, phones, and tablets. Even if you erase your data yourself, our team will still perform secondary verification and erasure to ensure no data remains.
